We needed a Content Management System that:

* Made our content look beautiful so people would actually want to read it.
* Leveraged the best in existing services (e.g., Segment, Google Analytics, Sumome, etc.) instead of trying to do everything itself.
* Didn't have a history of security issues that could tarnish our brand.
* Gave us the flexibility to extend it to do custom things if we ever needed to.
* Let us write content on any device, even when we were offline.
* Allowed us to maintain our identity by running on our own domain.
* Didn't waste collectively hours of our time publishing because we were fighting with a cumbersome interface that had to support every feature for every use case.

Lots of existing things came close but nothing quite fit all our needs. And so we took the awesome open source [NestaCMS](https://www.nestacms.com/), added in some
of the syncing and collaboration magic from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), added a few productivity and content sharing touches of our own and&hellip;

Now you have [ContentFocus](https://contentfocus.io/).
